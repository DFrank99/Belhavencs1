My pitch for my game is a shooting plat former.
It will be one level that last 5 minutes.
It will have two enemy sprites and one character sprite.
 One of 10-15 enemies will have more points than the others.
  There will be health.
   One health will be deducted when enemy hits.
   100 health and when hit -5.
